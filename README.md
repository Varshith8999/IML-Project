# AIR QUALITY PREDICTION



Air Quality Prediction Project Description
This project aims to predict the average pollutant level (e.g., PM2.5) in the air based on various features such as geographical location, date, and other related environmental factors using machine learning. The goal is to develop a model that can predict the concentration of a specific pollutant in a city or region given certain input details.
